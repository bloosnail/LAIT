General Usage

LAIT can be run from the command line as a Perl script, with the parameters entered in the same command. The exact inputs differ between software and can be seen by entering in the name of software followed by ways admixture.

An example to just see the required inputs for LAMP for 2-way admixture is below:

$ perl lait.pl lamp 2
Hello. This is LAIT.
USAGE:: perl lait.pl <lamp> <2> <map> <ped> <path>

The input files are all PLINK formatted, there are some examples at the bottom of this page. 


To actually create the files for LAMP for 2-way admixture, an example for chromosome 2 could be:

$ perl lait.pl lamp 2 ./admixed/chr2.map ./admixed/chr2.ped ./outputPath/


There are example files in the section labelled "Example Files". Listed here are brief descriptions of the various possible inputs (no <>) on any of them.

The choices for <software> are lamp, lamp-ld, hapmix, elai.
The number of <#waysAdmixed> is 2 or 3.
<chrNo> is the chromosome number (1-22) that the data is for
<map> is the admixed .map file
<ped> is the admixed .ped file
<snps> is the subset SNP list file for admixed and all reference populations, or the reference SNP list file for reference populations
<haps_pop*> are the haplotype files for each reference population
<snps_pop*> are the SNP list files for each reference population
<recmap> is the recombination rate file for a given chromosome
<path> is the output path that the files will be put into. It is recommended to type the absolute path out instead of using ../ or ./ or you may have to manually change the pathing if the admixture software you plan to use requires configuration/parameter files






Examples of format for input files:

Admixed Map
-White space delimited

Example:
1       rs6684487       0       791853
1       rs2905036       0       792480
1       rs12131377      0       795222
1       rs115861588     0       797820
1       rs4951864       0       798026


Admixed Ped
-I removed the first 6 lines of header from each before processing
-White space delimited

Example:
C C G G A G A A G G G G A A A A A A A A A A A G C C A A A A G A A A 0 0 G G A G

Reference SNP list
-It is just one snp name per line
